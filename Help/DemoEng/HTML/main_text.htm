<P>NCManager is a package of programs designed for visualizing, monitoring and 
  editing of mill, turn and mill-turn programs for machines with CNC. </P>
<P> The initial data for NCManager is the program text for a certain machine (G-code) 
  and the file defining CNC. The models, components and workpieces can be as well 
  loaded from STL files. </P>
<P> NCManager is designed for working both with the handmade programs and the 
  programs created with the help of any CAM system. In the second case one can 
  import all the necessary additional data (tools, workpiece) from CAM system. 
  In both cases one can either edit or recreate these data from within NCManager. 
  Besides, NCManager allows to edit a program text with the immediate display 
  of the changes made in the graphical window. </P>
<P> NCManager provides you with an opportunity to imitate a program execution 
  in various modes: from a mere trajectory drawing to a realistic imitation of 
  the removal procedure a workpiece material. In any mode a user has an access 
  to all current information about coordinates of any point of a workpiece, a 
  tool, a trajectory as well as all information about CNC status (feed, speed, 
  mode, etc.).</P>
<P> Hence, NCManager is a compact product easy to cope with which can significantly 
  simplify the work with all the variety of programs for NC machines irrespectively 
  of their origin.</P>
