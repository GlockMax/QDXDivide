<P>The tools created by NC Manager are the solids of rotation which can be conditionally divided into several types: they are the standard end and spherical mills, disk mills of various modifications, and jigs. Moreover, from these tools you can make up new ones, i.e. <A HREF="hidd_toolscon_create.htm">compound</A> tools.</P>

<P>Let's define the tools terminology. It is presented on the scheme. </P>

<P>To control the accuracy of technological operations a working surface as well as a non-working part of the surface can be set for every tool. A working surface is a part of the tool that removes material. Moreover, you can create elements of the tool fixture, i.e. jigs.</P>
