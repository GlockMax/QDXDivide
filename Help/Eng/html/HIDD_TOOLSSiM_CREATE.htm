<P>You can see from the scheme that an elementary tool is a kind of a tool which 
  serves as a part of a compound one. This very notion was introduced just to 
  distinguish between a compound tool and its constituent tools.</P>

<P>The common thing for all the elementary tools is that they are convex solids. 
  However, we also distinguish between them by the complexity of their geometry 
  (simple, complex) and by their function (a cutting tool and jigs).</P>
