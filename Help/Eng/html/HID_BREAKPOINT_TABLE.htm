<P>In the Main Menu: <STRONG>Work &gt;&nbsp;Breakpoints</STRONG></P>
<P>Quick activating:&nbsp;<IMG height="26" src="HID_BREAKPOINT_TABLE.files/image001.gif" width="26" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025">&nbsp;icon.</P>
<P>This command will show you the Breakpoints dialog box</P>

</p>
		<P>You can adjust <STRONG>Breakpoints </STRONG>by turning on or off the check boxes 
			next to the <STRONG>Breakpoint</STRONG> name. Turning on the <STRONG>Use Additional 
				Breakpoints </STRONG>button will let you stop the simulation process in the 
			positions defined by the <STRONG>Additional Breakpoints</STRONG>. To quickly 
			turn on or off all the <STRONG>Additional Breakpoints</STRONG>&nbsp;use this 
			icon - <IMG height="26" src="HID_BREAKPOINT_TABLE.files/image006.gif" width="26" align="absMiddle"
				v:shapes="_x0000_i1032">&nbsp;in the <STRONG>Breakpoints </STRONG>toolbar.</P>
		<p>For example, on the <STRONG>Breakpoints</STRONG> dialog box&nbsp;picture above 
			the simulation process will be stopped in such places:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>if the feed value will be changed;</p>
			<li>
				<p>if there is only Z-axis move&nbsp;(generally in the penetration or machine tool 
					pulling-out lines);</p>
			<li>
				<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;lines where the diameter compensation was turned 
  on.</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>What&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Breakpoint?</h1>
		<p>The simulation process always starts from the current machine tool 
			position&nbsp;in the project CNC program text. We need Breakpoints to have an 
			opportunity to set end points for the simulation or to find key positions of 
			the program that we work with. Thus if some of the <STRONG>Breakpoints</STRONG> 
			are turned on and we run <STRONG>To Breakpoint</STRONG> execution then the 
			simulation process will be executed from current position to the first enabled <STRONG>
				Breakpoint</STRONG>. This position will become the new current position of 
			the machine tool. The same result will be when running <IMG height="26" src="HID_BREAKPOINT_TABLE.files/image003.gif" width="26" align="absMiddle"
				v:shapes="_x0000_i1028">&nbsp;(<STRONG>Forward</STRONG>) and <IMG height="26" src="HID_BREAKPOINT_TABLE.files/image004.gif" width="26" align="absMiddle"
				v:shapes="_x0000_i1027">&nbsp;(<STRONG>Backward</STRONG>) commands. The 
			machine tool will be moved to the new position with no simulation.&nbsp;This 
			new position will also become current machine tool position in the CNC 
			project's program.</p>
		<P>Breakpoints are divided into two groups. Main and Additional. The only difference 
			between them is that you can find&nbsp;<STRONG>Main Breakpoints</STRONG> in the <STRONG>
				Breakpoints</STRONG> toolbar also to control the process more quickly:</P>
		<P>
			<img width="199" height="58" src="HID_BREAKPOINT_TABLE.files/image005.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029">
		</P>
		<P>Here you can find four <STRONG>Breakpoints</STRONG>. They will stop the 
			simulation process in the beginning or in the end of every CNC program, after 
			the Breakpoint line, after machine tool changing line, or in the bookmarked 
			line.&nbsp;</P>
		<P>Control of the Additional Breakpoints status can be held by pushing <IMG height="26" src="HID_BREAKPOINT_TABLE.files/image006.gif" width="26" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030">&nbsp;(<STRONG>Additional 
				Breakpoints</STRONG>)&nbsp;button. If you want to adjust the list of 
			Additional Breakpoints then push <IMG height="26" src="HID_BREAKPOINT_TABLE.files/image001.gif" width="26" align="absMiddle"
				v:shapes="_x0000_i1025">&nbsp;<STRONG>Breakpoints</STRONG> button.</P>
