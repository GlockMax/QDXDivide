<P>In order to check or to gain an understanding of a specific NC program (G-code), 
  you can find two simulation modes in NCManager:</P>
<P> 1. <strong><font color="#FF00FF">Don’t cut</font></strong> - toolpath view 
  in the form of lines and arcs with no stock cut. You need only to define the 
  CNC control and to start program itself.</P>
<P> 2. <strong><font color="#FF00FF">Cut</font></strong> - in addition to toolpath 
  view in this mode you have an opportunity to make a stock cut simulation. You 
  also need to define tools and stock.</P>
<P> You can define machine tool as well and as the result of it you will have 
  the stock and tool moving view in the special Machine window depending on the 
  machine tool kinematics. The 3x machine tool only with kinematics is loaded 
  by default.</P>
<h1>NCManager Project File</h1>
<P> Project file have an .NCM extension. All information about loaded CNC Programs, 
  tools, stock and others is kept in project file.</P>
<P> Main menu command <strong>File</strong>:</P>
<P> <strong><font color="#FF00FF">Save</font></strong> and <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Save 
  as</strong></font> commands will save new or already created project.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Open ...</strong></font>, command is used to 
  open existent project in new window. </P>
<h1>Define Types of projects</h1>
<P> In NCManager we have three types of projects. Milling, Turning, and Milling-Turning.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Create</strong></font> –This function creates 
  project of active type.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Create Mill</strong></font> - Mill project is 
  developed for milling machine simulation. In this project you can load only 
  milling tool and milling stock.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Create Lathe</strong></font> - Lathe project 
  is developed for lathe machine simulation. In this project you can load only 
  lathe tool and lathe stock.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Create Mill Turn</strong></font> - Mill Turn 
  project is developed for mill turn machine simulation. However you can use it 
  also for milling and lathe machining. In this project you can load lathe tool, 
  milling tool, lathe stock and milling stock. </P>
<h1>Define CNC Control Type</h1>
<p> Find <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>CNC Control</strong></font> item on the 
  left part of the screen. Press right mouse button. Then click <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Load</strong></font>, 
  and in window choose appropriate defining CNC control file. NCManager will load 
  <strong>ISO.SM3</strong> file by default.</p>
<h1>Define Machine Tool</h1>
<p> Find <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Machine</strong></font> item on the left 
  part of the screen. Press right mouse button. Then click <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Load</strong></font>, 
  and in window choose appropriate machine tool. NCManager will load <strong>3X_DEFAULT</strong> 
  machine tool by default.</p>
<H1>CNC Program Loading</H1>

<P> Find <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>CNC-Programs</strong></font> item on the 
  left part of the screen. Then press right mouse button and click <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Load</strong></font>. 
  Choose file with NC program.</P>

<H1>Operating with Views</H1>

<P>In order to control the views (to have an opportunity to examine the picture), 
  <strong>press right mouse button</strong> on a graphic window. Appeared toolbar 
  consist of 24 buttons that will help you to operate with image size and to arrange 
  image position on the screen. You can use the same actions from the <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Main 
  menu</strong></font> (choose <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>View</strong></font>). 
  Elements of this menu are enabled if the graphic window is active. Therefore 
  if you see that necessary function is disabled you just need to click on the 
  graphic window. </P>
<P> Comfortable way of view point dynamic controlling is accessible if you push 
  <strong>Ctrl</strong>, <strong>Shift</strong>, or <strong>Alt</strong> button 
  with right mouse button. <strong>Ctrl</strong> is used for dynamic rotation, 
  <strong>Shift</strong> - for panning and <strong>Alt</strong> - for scale changing. 
</P>
<H1>View the CNC Program Text</H1>

<P>You can view and edit the CNC program text in the following way. Double click 
  on <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>CNC-Programs</strong></font>. You will see 
  the list of loaded NC programs. Then double click on the required program name 
  and the program text will be loaded into the <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Editor 
  Pane</strong></font>. The name of the NC program which text is loaded in the 
  textbox appears bold. After that you can simply edit this text. </P>
<P> In order to apply the changes click right mouse button and choose <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Update</strong></font>.</P>
<h1>View the Toolpath</h1>
<P> There are two types of the main graphical window <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Stock</strong></font> 
  and <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Machine</strong></font>. Sub menu Window from 
  main menu commands switch this types. There are two additional graphical panes 
  <font color="#FF00FF"> <strong>Stock</strong></font> and <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Machine</strong></font>. 
  This panes can be visible simultaneously with the main graphical window. The 
  visibility of this panes can be switched on and off by main menu command <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Settings</strong></font> 
  &gt; <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Panes</strong></font>.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Stock</strong></font> - in this window you can 
  see the wireframe toolpath and the machine tool movement during the simulation 
  process.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Machine</strong></font> - in this window you 
  can see the wireframe toolpath and the movement in accordance with kinematics 
  machine tool scheme.</P>
<P> While you move your mouse over the toolpath image CNC program lines and nodes 
  will be highlighted. At the same time cursor shape is showing you the element 
  type and the toolpath direction (Stock Window must be active). </P>
<P> Choose <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Geometry Pane</strong></font> and you 
  will find geometric information about specified toolpath element.</P>
<P> Left mouse button click on any toolpath part will lead to loading of the corresponding 
  CNC program into the <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Editor Pane</strong></font> 
  and to the pointing on the corresponding line. </P>
<P> Double click will cause program run until current line. This is how you can 
  find out the time of program run until current line or any other parameters 
  of the current CNC control condition which are available from <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Parameters 
  Pane</strong></font>. </P>
<H1>Tools Loading</H1>

<P>For simulation of the NC program work it is necessary to define tools and stock. 
  To create a tool click right mouse button on <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Tools</strong></font> 
  and choose <strong><font color="#FF00FF">Create</font></strong>. In the appeared 
  dialog window you can choose tool type, size and position.</P>

<H1>Stock Creating</H1>

<P>To create a stock in much the same way choose <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Create</strong></font> 
  and then choose <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>stock type</strong></font> and 
  size. <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Bounding Box</strong></font> button allows 
  you to define stock size automatically using work move dimensions in NC program 
  taking into account given offset.</P>

<H1>Work Simulation</H1>

<P>Both Cut and Don’t Cut modes my be in one of four motion modes. Motion mode 
  can be changed by the main menu Work or by the toolbar icons. Tool motion speed 
  can be changed by the toolbar slider.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Smoothly</strong></font> – When this motion 
  mode is active the tool moves smoothly along the toolpath.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Feedrate</strong></font> - When this motion 
  mode is active the tool moves smoothly along the toolpath. The speed of the 
  tool motion corresponds to the federate defined in the CNC program.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Quick</strong></font> - When this motion mode 
  is active the tool position is shown by the given time interval.</P>
<P> <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Result</strong></font> - When this motion mode 
  is active no tool motion is displayed.</P>
<P> To view the stock cutting with the smooth tool motion it is necessary to:</P>
<P> 1. Turn on <strong>Cut</strong> mode<br>
  2. Turn on <strong>Smoothly</strong> motion mode<br>
  3. Choose <strong>Execute</strong> &gt; <strong>To breakpoint</strong> command 
  from main menu Work. </P>
<H1>Taking Measurements</H1>
<P> You are able to measure machined stock and to get an information about machined 
  surface type and its parameters using the <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Measures</strong></font> 
  command. You can taking measurement only in <strong>Stock</strong> window.</P>

<H1>Section</H1>
<P> Using <font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Section</strong></font> command you can 
  build dynamic sections with different planes. You can build sections only in 
  <strong>Stock</strong> window.</P>
