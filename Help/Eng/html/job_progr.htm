<P>The next step of the work with NCManager is the addition of NC program presented in G-codes. A certain command that sets this or that machine operation corresponds to every line of this program. You can either <B>Create</B> a new or <B>Load</B> an already existing program.</P>

<H1>Program Creation</H1>

<P>You can create a program by selecting the <B>Create</B> item on the menu that appears on right-clicking the <B>Programs</B> item on the Object panel. In the opened dialog you should create a filename and a catalog where you will place the program being created.</P>

<P><B>Remember</B> that a newly created program is not added automatically into the project. To add it you should <B>Load</B>.</P>

<H1>Program Load</H1>

<P>To load a program you should select the <B>Programs</B> item on the Object panel, right-click it and select the <B>Load</B><B>...</B> item on the menu appeared.</P>

<P><B>Remember</B> that if you work with NCManager demo version, you will not be able to load your program.</P>

<H1>Display of the Loaded Program</H1>

<P>In order to view the text of the loaded program you should double-click the 
  left button on the selected program. This program will be displayed in the textbox.</P>

  them in the graphical window. You can do this by selecting the <B>Apply</B> 
  item (on the contextual menu that appears when you right-click the textbox) 
  or pressing Ctrl+R keys.</P>
