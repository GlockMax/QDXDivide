<P>Measuring the machined stock. This command is enable when one of the following modes is turned 
					on - <IMG height="26" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image002.gif" width="26" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027">
					(<A href="HID_RESULT_MODE.htm">Result</A>), <IMG height="26" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image003.gif" width="26" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028">

		<P>When you push <IMG height="26" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image001.gif" width="26" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030">&nbsp;icon, 
			you will see the Measure dialog box:</P>
		
<p> <img width="197" height="250" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image006.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> 
</p>
		<P>Also the Measure tab in the Control panel will turn on automatically. In this 
			tab you can find the information of type and parameters of a <STRONG><FONT color="#000099">
					real</FONT></STRONG> surface that you are pointing on in the Stock 
			window. Just move mouse cursor over the machined&nbsp;stock and&nbsp;look on 
			the information in the Control panel. There are such surface types as cylinder, 
			plane, torus etc. For more details, see <STRONG>Control Panel</STRONG>&nbsp;&gt;
			<STRONG>Measure tab</STRONG>.</P>

		<P>To measure the distance between any two stock walls that have metal inside them, 
			the following mode should be turned on:</P>
		<P><IMG height="30" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image008.gif" width="28" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"></P>
		<P>Then when pushing left mouse button program will measure the distance on the 
			stock body direction. The yellow line will show you what was measured. Green 
			ball is the start point, red - end.</P>
		
<p> <img width="532" height="455" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image009.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> 
</p>
		<P>In the Coordinates&nbsp;textboxes of a dialog box you will see the start point 
			coordinates.</P>
		<P>In the Direction&nbsp;textboxes of a dialog box you will see the direction 
			vector. As indicated on the picture above&nbsp;this is the direction along the 
			Y-axis. The direction is counted automatically by a normal to the surface in 
			the chosen point, if the <STRONG>Constant Direction</STRONG> is not checked.</P>
		<P>In the Result textboxes you will see the end point coordinates and the distance. 
			In the example above it is L13.85.</P>
		<P>You can set the start point coordinates and the direction&nbsp;on the screen by 
			setting the values in the corresponding textboxes. In the example below it is 
			the point with the 40,40,-5 coordinates and with direction along the X-axis. 
			After you push <IMG height="30" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image010.gif" width="28" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035">
			(<STRONG>Execute</STRONG>), you will see the end point coordinates and 
			direction.&nbsp;</P>
		
<p> <img width="529" height="447" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image011.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"></p>
		<P>As in our example the point is "in the air" then in the Result textboxes you 
			will see&nbsp;the distance between start point to the both sides of the given 
			direction and the total distance. Also you will se the both end points 
			coordinates.</P>
		<P>You&nbsp; can also set the constant direction checking the <STRONG>Constant 
				Direction</STRONG> check box in the Measure dialog box. Then if you choose 
			on of the points, program will measure the distance and the&nbsp;end 
			point&nbsp; coordinates using the&nbsp;constant direction.&nbsp;</P>
		
<h1> <img width="563" height="423" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image012.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"> 
</h1>
		<p>In this example direction is 1,1,0, i.e. 45 degrees.</p>
		<P>To measure the distance between the stock edges with the "air" between them 
			(grooves, apertures) you have to choose the mode shown below:
		</P>
		<p>
			<img width="28" height="30" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image013.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038">
		</p>
		<P>Then the&nbsp; "to the air" direction distance will be measured. You will see 
			the&nbsp; yellow line that shows you what was measured. Green ball - start 
			point, red ball - end point.</P>
		
        <p> <img width="545" height="443" src="HID_MEASURE.files/image014.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1039"> 
</p>
		<P>In each measure the <STRONG><FONT color="#000099">real</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp;machined 
			stock dimensions are measured that are independent of the stock 
			model&nbsp;approximation accuracy during the simulation process.
