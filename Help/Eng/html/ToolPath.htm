		<h1>Toolpath</h1>
		<P>Now we will take a look at some<FONT color="black"> toolpath learning items.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT color="black">While you move your mouse over the toolpath image CNC program 
				lines and nodes will be highlighted. At the same time cursor shape&nbsp;is 
				showing you the element type and the toolpath direction (Stock Window must be 
				active). Choose <STRONG>Geom</STRONG> tab&nbsp;on the Control Panel and you 
				will find geometric information about specified toolpath element. You can point 
				on element (line, arc) and see geometric information about them. If you point 
				on node you can also see the angle between two elements. Thus, for example you 
				can assess toolpath transition smoothness. </FONT>

		<P>In the bottom part of the screen you can see coordinates of the cursor position, 
			line number and CNC program name.</P>
		
<P><IMG height="118" src="../images/status.gif" width="382" border="0"></P>
		<P>Three numbers on the right are the coordinates relatively to the CNC program "0" 
			point. Next to these numbers on the left there are another three numbers 
			showing us coordinates relatively to the cursor position (you can change this 
			"0" point by simply clicking somewhere on the Graphic Window). Number in the 
			brackets shows the distance.</P>
		<P>Left mouse button click on any toolpath part&nbsp;will lead to loading of the 
			corresponding CNC program into the Text Window and to the pointing on the 
			corresponding line.
		</P>
		<P>Double click will cause program run until current line. This is how you can find 
			out the time of program run until current line or any other parameters of the 
			current CNC control condition which are available from&nbsp;<STRONG>CNC-Control </STRONG>
			tab . You can set the number of displayed parameters of the <STRONG>CNC-Control&nbsp;</STRONG>from
			<STRONG>Settings - Control panel</STRONG> <FONT color="#ff0000"></FONT><FONT color="black">
				or from the contextual menu of the Control Panel.</FONT></P>
		<P>Now we will <a href="../html/LoadTool.htm">load a tool</a> because our aim is to 
			view solid simulation of machining.</P>
