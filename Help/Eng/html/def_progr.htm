<P>To load a file containing program text in the project. If the project has at 
  least one program, the icon changes its color from red to green.</P>

<P></P>

<H2>Create</H2>

<P>To create a new program.</P>

<H2>Renew</H2>

<P>To load again texts of all the programs included in the project from the corresponding files.</P>

<H2>Show All</H2>

<P>To make toolpaths of all the programs in the project visible.</P>

<H2>Hide All</H2>

<P>To make toolpaths of all the programs in the project invisible on the screen. The icon changes its color to dark green.</P>

<H2>Change Visibility</H2>

<P>To make the hidden toolpaths visible and to hide the visible toolpaths included in the project.</P>

<H2>Without Compensation</H2>

<H2>With Compensation</H2>

<P>The corresponding mode being set, the program is displayed without/with compensation taken into account. Thus, if both of the modes are set, then the programmed toolpath and the toolpath with compensation are displayed simultaneously. Only the first mode is set by default, i.e. only the programmed toolpath is displayed.</P>

<H2>Worked-out Toolpath</H2>

<P>If the mode is set, only the toolpath section from the beginning to the current block is displayed. This mode helps to get the effect of the “wire-frame simulation”, i.e. the effect of the gradual drawing of the toolpath as the program is being executed.</P>

<P>If at least one of the programs exists in the project, a list of the loaded programs which you can <A HREF="job_progr.htm">View and Edit</A> in the textbox appears when you double-click the left button.</P>

<P>You right-click any of the program and the <A HREF="hid_ch_progr.htm">Program contextual menu</A> is activated.</P>
